Analysis done on the Kepler objects of interest cumulative dataset

	
Some analysis done on the KOI cumulative dataset.
* Plotted histograms of various variables
* Added Earth and Sun reference data where appropriate
* Plotted exoplanet radius vs orbital period, scatter plot.
* Used a few variables for setting the colour scale
* Used a filter on ex. eq. temp. with a progressively narrowing gate to see the effect on the data. Gathered some insight.

To do
* add a fit to the peak in the histogram of exoplanet orbital period
* add gate colouring to histograms (conditional colouring)
* add inset plot
